PROBLEM

This is the time to use your front-end skills and implement some UI for accounts.

1. Creat UI routes (in the browser client app) for /accounts so you can see the page on http://localhost:9000/accounts.
2. Code the template with these elements:

* Form
* List of existing accounts

3. Supply the data from the server via the controller.
4. Implement the method to save the new account


--

BONUS

Implement the delete buttons (both HTML and controller calls to API).

---

HINTS

To create UI routes use `$ yo angular-fullstack:route accounts`. Answer default answers to questions `client/app` and `/accounts`.

The database must be running in its own window/tab or in detached mode. To start the DB, run `$ mongod`.
The webdriver must be running with `$ webdriver start`.

The template can look like this http://bit.ly/1TB5g7B.

The controller uses this code: http://bit.ly/1TB59c8.
