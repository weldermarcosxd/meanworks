PROBLEM

This is the time to use your front-end skills and implement some UI for transactions.

1. Creat UI routes (in the browser client app) for /transactions so you can see the page on http://localhost:9000/transactions.
2. Code the table with these fields:

* Date
* Description
* Category
* Amount
* Action

3. Supply the data from the server via the controller.

BONUS

Implement dispute and cancel dispute buttons (both HTML and controller calls to API).

HINTS

To create UI routes use `$ yo angular-fullstack:route transactions`. Answer default answers to questions `client/app` and `/transactions`.

The database must be running in its own window/tab or in detached mode. To start the DB, run `$ mongod`.
The webdriver must be running with `$ webdriver start`.

The table code can look like this http://bit.ly/1TB1IC0.

The controller uses $http.get like this to get the data from the server:

$http.get('/api/transactions').success(function(transactions) {
  $scope.transactions = transactions;
});

Once you assign a property to the scope, it will be available in your template thanks to two-way binding. Therefore, we can access transactions in `transactions.html` with:


  <tr ng-repeat="transaction in transactions">
