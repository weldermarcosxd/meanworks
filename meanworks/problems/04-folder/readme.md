PROBLEM

We need to create a folder for our project, so everything can stay neat and well organized.

Create a folder with the name is `ng-fullstack-new` in the meanworks folder, and navigate (cd) into it. This is where you'll put all of your project files.

Create full stack MEAN project ng-fullstack-new with this command (inside of the newly created folder):

$ yo angular-fullstack ng-fullstack-new


BONUS points if you copy these script commands into your new package.json:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "node ./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js index.js",
  "seed-transactions": "mongoimport  --host=127.0.0.1 --port=27017 --db ngfullstacknew-dev --collection transactions --file transactions.json --jsonArray",
  "seed-accounts": "mongoimport  --host=127.0.0.1 --port=27017 --db ngfullstacknew-dev --collection accounts --file accounts.json --jsonArray"
},

We'll be using these commands later.

HINTS

Use `$ mkdir ng-fullstack-new` to create folder and `$ cd ng-fullstack-new` to navigate into it.

To generate the app, use `$ yo angular-fullstack ng-fullstack-new`.
